HTML Converter Kata
===================

Write the unit tests for the HtmlTextConverter class. The HtmlTextConverter class is designed to reformat a plain text file for display in a browser. 

Bonus: identify which of the SOLID principles this code violates.

The HtmlPagesConverter is a slightly more challenging version of the same underlying design problem.
